    " 2:58 I work with children of Angus's age. ",
    " 3:02 I spoke to my headteacher and he very, very kindly offered to let Angus attend the nursery setting. ",
    " 3:10 That must have been a relief. ",

    " 3:27 What's it been like putting your children into childcare and the kind of cost there's been around that? ",
    " 3:32 Our childcare has cost more than our rent each month. ",
    " 3:36 We paid around £12,000 last year. ",
    " 3:39 By the time the childcare had left my wages, I was actually working for maybe £300 per month. ",

    " 3:49 The thing is, Becci's situation is far from unique. ",

    " 4:05 But nurseries are really  struggling too and they say  they can't afford the increased cost of staffing, they can't afford the increased cost of energy and they are increasingly closing their doors. ",
    " 4:16 They say that the free hours that they provide at the moment aren't sufficiently funded by the government and haven't been for years. ",
    " 4:24 Now, the government has promised a revolution in childcare. ",

",
    " 4:48 Do you know how much it costs for a childcare place in the UK? ",
    " 4:52 It's about £14,000 a year. ",

    " 4:58 I mean, just incredible. ",

    " 5:37 I mean, it's a mess, it's just an absolute mess. ",
    " 5:42 It's unaffordable, it's inaccessible, it's entirely dysfunctional. ",
    " 5:47 There's nothing good about it and if we compare it to other countries, we are falling way way behind, embarrassingly so. ",
    " 5:55 Where does it better? ",
    " 5:57 Pretty much every country does it better than we do. ",
    " 6:01 No country though, I would say, has got it spot on. ",
    " 6:04 Countries tend to focus either on the quality of provision that they're providing and seeing it really as early years education or they see it as a way to get women back into the workforce. ",
    " 6:16 We are doing neither, we're failing at both. ",
    " 6:19 However, if they fail to deliver that first stage of this plan, it's political suicide. ",
    " 6:25 So yes, I am confident things will now get better. ",
    " 6:29 Can't really get any worse, can they? ",
    " 6:30 They can't get any worse, no, they really can't. ",
    " Childcare crisis in the UK So it's really difficult the spring budget. ",
    " 6:36 On the one hand, it will help many parents who are really struggling at the moment, but as someone who's covered this area a lot, I know that it's not as simple as that. ",
    ` 6:46 It's not as simple as: "Oh, this is going to fix everything," because what happens when you suddenly put loads more demand into this sector that is already teetering on the brink of collapse? `,
    " 6:58 So, we're going to go and speak to Neil Leitch, who is the CEO of the Early Years Alliance and see what he thinks about it. ",
    " 7:05 How would you describe the state of childcare in this country at the moment? ",
    " 7:10 Absolute crisis. ",
    " 7:11 This year we have seen record closures, nearly 5,500 providers have closed their doors. ",
    " 7:17 I've never witnessed the recruitment and retention crisis as grave as it is now. ",
    " 7:22 If this continues, you know, in commercial terms you would argue it would be a market collapse, but in real terms we prejudice the life chances of lots and lots of children. ",
    " 7:32 When you heard those announcements, what was your initial reaction? ",
    " 7:39 I probably couldn't explain on camera what my real reaction was, but definitely anger. ",
    " 7:45 None of this can be delivered. ",
    " 7:47 We have settings closing, we have settings reducing their hours, we have parents struggling to get access for their three- and four-year-olds. ",
    " 7:55 Why would you extend that even further, knowing that you can't cope with what you've got? ",
    " 8:00 All you've done is, dare I say, pile on more pressure. ",
    " 8:05 What do you think is going to happen in the next few years when this huge increase in demand is going to come into the sector? ",
    " 8:10 Well the logic says that there would be parents who will be turning up at settings, whether it be childminders, preschools or nurseries, expecting places for their children and they won't be there. ",
    " Madcaps nursery: we need ministers who care about early years education This is a sector that's in a lot of trouble. ",
    " 8:27 We know that nurseries are shutting their doors all the time, we know that other nurseries are really struggling to retain staff and they're just keeping their heads above water. ",
    " 8:39 We've come to Madcaps nursery in Lincolnshire, where the owner has had to take extreme measures just to keep the doors open. ",
    " 8:47 How long have you been open? ",
    " 8:48 We've been open about 12 years. ",
    " 8:50 We look at what's called the curiosity approach, so the children get their hands dirty, like they are over there and they really get to enjoy it. ",
    " 8:56 I can see, they're really getting into it here. ",
    " 8:59 She's busy planting things. ",
    " 9:01 What is it good early years education can bring to a child and to a family? ",
    " 9:06 Security, happiness, resilience. ",
    " 9:10 Children need to know how to deal with other people, how to deal with conflict, how to share. ",
    " 9:15 If you can give children that solid framework to start their lives, they've  got that for their life. ",
    " 9:23 How difficult has it been over the past couple of years as a provider? ",
    " 9:27 Awful. ",
    " 9:28 It's not an easy job, you've got a lot of skills, a lot of knowledge, a lot of experience and you're getting less money than somebody who works in our local supermarket, for example. ",
    " 9:36 It says what do you call a gorilla wearing headphones? ",
    " 9:40 A dancing gorilla. ",
    ` 9:42 It says "Anything you like, he can't hear you." Talk to us about how you've coped with the financial squeeze on the nursery. `,
    " 9:52 We've cut down on things that we buy, tried not to as much as possible and every penny goes back in all the time to make sure we've got what we need. ",
    " 10:01 It was quite a drastic measure that you personally took though, in order to keep on paying staff here, wasn't it? ",
